# Phase E — The forker registration playbook

Goal: embed, into the produced starter, everything the **downstream forker's agent**
needs to take *its human* from a fresh fork to a live product — register their own
VVibe + Portaly accounts, paste keys, and provision remote resources.

`scripts/write_playbook.mjs` writes three files into the starter:
- `VVIBE_STARTER.md` — the playbook (content below)
- `.env.example` — placeholders (see `env-templates.md`)
- `.mcp.json` — VVibe MCP server entry, tokenless OAuth (see `env-templates.md`)

This doc is the **source text** for `VVIBE_STARTER.md`. Keep the script and this doc
in sync.

## Source text for `VVIBE_STARTER.md`

> # Get this starter live
>
> This project is **vvibe-optimized**: analytics, members, email, blog, and payments
> are wired through the [VVibe](https://vvibe.ai) + [Portaly](https://portaly.cc)
> skills already in `.claude/skills/`. The showcase code is real — it starts working
> the moment you plug in your own accounts. This file walks you (or your AI agent)
> through that.
>
> **Start by connecting VVibe — that's what this starter is for.** The fastest path to
> value is to register + onboard VVibe (step 1) and Portaly payments (step 2). It is not a
> hard prerequisite — you *can* deploy (step 5) with no VVibe connection — but connecting is
> the primary path: run `npx @vvibe/cli login --server=https://mcp.vvibe.ai`, which works in
> any session — interactive or headless — with just one browser click from the human (no
> token to copy). Payment (Portaly) needs its own quick web signup for a key — see step 2.
>
> > **No AI agent? Do it by hand.** Every step below works manually: sign up at the
> > linked sites, paste keys into `.env`, and deploy from the InsForge dashboard. The
> > agent path just automates the clicks. Where a step says "ask your agent", the
> > manual route is the linked dashboard — and for VVibe, the simplest manual route is
> > creating an **API key** (step 1, REST path) and pasting it into `.env`; running
> > `npx @vvibe/cli login --server=https://mcp.vvibe.ai` yourself works too if you'd
> > rather use the MCP path.
>
> ## 1. Connect VVibe (start here — the register + onboard flow)
> VVibe powers members, email, blog, and the analytics dashboard. Connecting is the main
> thing this starter sets you up to do — do it first. (It's not required just to *deploy*
> the app — step 5 works without it — but it's the primary path.) One command handles it
> in any session — interactive or headless; a REST API key is the fallback only if truly
> nobody can click through the one-time login.
>
> **The one-command path — works in any session, interactive or headless.** Just tell
> your agent to get started; here's what it does:
> 1. The agent runs `npx @vvibe/cli login --server=https://mcp.vvibe.ai` **itself** —
>    the same command whether it's running in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or a headless
>    / background session. This is the agent's job — don't type it yourself.
> 2. The CLI opens a browser to **https://vvibe.ai** and also prints the login URL to
>    the terminal, so even a headless agent can hand you the link to click. **Sign up
>    or log in once** (Google / magic link — no card). That one click *is* your
>    onboarding: it creates your account, sets up your workspace, and mints a
>    long-lived credential.
> 3. The CLI writes that credential straight into your MCP config — with the
>    `Authorization` header already wired in — for whichever client is running (Claude
>    Code, Cursor, or Codex). No token to copy, no manual editing, and it keeps working
>    headless from then on. (Claude Code users: `/mcp` still works as a manual fallback
>    to re-authorize.)
> 4. Once `vibe_heartbeat` works, the agent **sets your product basics** so the dashboard
>    and skills have context: `vibe_get_brand` shows what's blank, then `vibe_update_brand`
>    fills your **product name**, **website** (`appBaseUrl`), and a short plain-language
>    **description**. Your product website is **required for analytics** — if the agent
>    can't find it in the repo it'll ask you. (Edit these any time in dashboard
>    **Settings** — a fresh account starts blank, so don't skip this or the dashboard
>    stays empty.)
> 5. Then the agent **registers the pre-installed skills** so VVibe turns on their tools:
>    this starter ships the VVibe skills in `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`, so
>    VVibe doesn't know about them yet and their `vibe_*` tools stay hidden until it's
>    told. For **each** VVibe skill folder the agent calls `vibe_report_skill_installed`
>    (reading the `version:` from that skill's `SKILL.md`), which turns on their tools
>    (e.g. `vibe_list_members`) and marks onboarding complete. (Two differ: **analytics**
>    connects your Google Analytics via a hosted click; **blog-render** is read-only.)
>
> **No human available at all (rare) — the REST API-key fallback.** Headless still runs
> `login` first — the printed URL is meant to be handed to a human, so don't skip
> straight to this. Only if truly nobody can click it right now: create a **VVibe API
> key** (`pcs_test_…` / `pcs_live_…`) in the dashboard at https://vvibe.ai and put
> `VVIBE_API_KEY=…` in `.env`. Member sync, analytics, and product-brain work over REST
> with no browser; email and blog are MCP-only, so they wait until someone runs `login`
> (skill registration in sub-step 5 turns on the `vibe_*` tools, which only an agent
> uses). Self-hosters on a token-only host (`MCP_OAUTH_ENABLED` off) use the same key
> path, or paste an MCP connection token into `.mcp.json` as a `Bearer` header. Keep
> secrets out of git.
>
> ## 2. Register Portaly Payment (~3 min)
> 1. Go to **https://portaly.cc/payment** and create an account.
> 2. In the Portaly dashboard, issue an API key + **callback secret**. Start with a
>    **test** key (`pcs_test_…`) — TapPay sandbox, no real charges.
> 3. Put them in `.env` yourself (never paste secrets into a chat):
>    ```
>    PORTALY_API_KEY=pcs_test_xxx
>    PORTALY_CALLBACK_SECRET=xxx
>    ```
> 4. Make sure `.env` is git-ignored.
>
> ## 3. Provision your resources (let your agent drive)
> With keys in place, ask your agent to use the pre-installed skills:
> - **portaly-payment** — create your subscription plan(s) / product(s) and merchant
>   config, then confirm the checkout in this starter works end to end.
> - **vvibe-analytics** — set your GA4 measurement ID and connect GA to the VVibe
>   dashboard so traffic + the showcase events show up.
> - **vvibe-product-brain** — teach VVibe about your product (powers email / blog).
> - **vvibe-member**, **vvibe-email**, **vvibe-blog-writer/render** — add as you grow.
>
> **No AI agent?** Do the same in the web dashboards — the skills just automate
> these: create your plan(s)/product(s) at https://portaly.cc/payment, and connect
> Google Analytics from the VVibe dashboard at https://vvibe.ai/dashboard/analytics.
> Then fill the resulting ids/keys into `.env` (see `.env.example` for the names).
>
> ## 4. Make it yours
> Restyle the UI, swap the showcase product for your real offer, and ship. The
> wiring stays the same — you only changed the content and the keys.
>
> ## 5. Deploy to InsForge (recommended)
> **InsForge** is vvibe's hosting partner — it deploys this app and can be your
> backend (database, auth, storage, functions) as you build past the showcase.
> 1. Sign up at **https://insforge.dev/auth/sign-up?ref=VVIBE** (free to start).
> 2. Deploy with the InsForge CLI — or, if your agent has the **insforge** /
>    **insforge-cli** skill, ask it to deploy this starter; it provisions your
>    project and pushes the frontend, writing its own config.
> 3. Add your VVibe + Portaly env vars (steps 1–2) to the InsForge project so the
>    live site can reach them.
>
> ## Cheat sheet
> | Need | Where |
> |---|---|
> | VVibe connect (any session) | agent runs `npx @vvibe/cli login --server=https://mcp.vvibe.ai`; one browser click, no token to copy |
> | VVibe connect (no human available) | `VVIBE_API_KEY` in `.env` — from the VVibe dashboard, no browser |
> | Product basics (name / website / description) | agent checks with `vibe_get_brand`, then sets via `vibe_update_brand`, or dashboard Settings — website (`appBaseUrl`) is required for analytics |
> | Portaly account | https://portaly.cc/payment |
> | Portaly key + callback secret | Portaly dashboard → creator-subscription |
> | Deploy / hosting | InsForge — https://insforge.dev/auth/sign-up?ref=VVIBE |
> | What's wired & where | the `## ⚡ vvibe-optimized` block in `AGENTS.md` |

## Notes for the production agent

- Do **not** fill in any real values — the playbook is instructions for the forker.
- `.env.example` must contain **placeholders only**. `.mcp.json` ships the public
  cloud MCP URL (`https://mcp.vvibe.ai`) with **no token** — OAuth is per-forker and
  happens in the browser, so there is no secret to place here.
- If the base app already has a `VVIBE_STARTER.md`, the script overwrites it (it owns
  that file); the marker block in `AGENTS.md` is what's merged idempotently.
