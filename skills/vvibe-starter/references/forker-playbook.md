# Phase E — The forker registration playbook

Goal: embed, into the produced starter, everything the **downstream forker's agent**
needs to take *its human* from a fresh fork to a live product — register their own
VVibe + Portaly accounts, paste keys, and provision remote resources.

`scripts/write_playbook.mjs` writes three files into the starter:
- `VVIBE_STARTER.md` — the playbook (content below)
- `.env.example` — placeholders (see `env-templates.md`)
- `.mcp.json` — VVibe MCP server entry, tokenless OAuth (see `env-templates.md`)

This doc is the **source text** for `VVIBE_STARTER.md`. Keep the script and this doc
in sync.

> # Get this starter live
>
> This project is **vvibe-optimized**: analytics, members, email, blog, and payments
> are wired through the [VVibe](https://vvibe.ai) + [Portaly](https://portaly.cc)
> skills already in `.claude/skills/`. The showcase code is real — it starts working
> the moment you plug in your own accounts. This file walks you (or your AI agent)
> through that.
>
> **Start by connecting VVibe — that's what this starter is for.** The fastest path to
> value is to register + onboard VVibe (step 1) and Portaly payments (step 2). It is not a
> hard prerequisite — you *can* deploy (step 5) with no VVibe connection — but connecting is
> the primary path: in an interactive session it's a one-time browser login (no token to
> copy), and in a headless setup you use a REST API key instead. Payment (Portaly) needs
> its own quick web signup for a key — see step 2.
>
> > **No AI agent? Do it by hand.** Every step below works manually: sign up at the
> > linked sites, paste keys into `.env`, and deploy from the InsForge dashboard. The
> > agent path just automates the clicks. Where a step says "ask your agent", the
> > manual route is the linked dashboard — and for VVibe, use the **API-key path**
> > (step 1, non-interactive) instead of the one-click MCP login.
>
> ## 1. Connect VVibe (start here — the register + onboard flow)
> VVibe powers members, email, blog, and the analytics dashboard. Connecting is the main
> thing this starter sets you up to do — do it first. (It's not required just to *deploy*
> the app — step 5 works without it — but it's the primary path.) There are two ways to
> connect; pick the one that matches how your agent runs.
>
> **Interactive session (a human can click once) — the one-browser-login path.** Your
> agent does the wiring; your only step is a single browser login. Just tell it to get
> started; here's what it does:
> 1. **Claude Code** — `.mcp.json` already wires the VVibe MCP server, so the agent just
>    calls `vibe_heartbeat`. (You can also run `/mcp` to authorize it.)
> 2. **Cursor / Codex** (config isn't `.mcp.json`) — the agent first runs
>    `npx @vvibe/cli connect --server=https://mcp.vvibe.ai` **itself** to write the server
>    into your config (reload if prompted; it only writes config — it does *not* log you
>    in), then calls `vibe_heartbeat`. This is the agent's job — don't type it.
> 3. That first call opens a browser to **https://vvibe.ai** → **sign up or log in once**
>    (Google / magic link — no card). That one login *is* your onboarding: it creates
>    your account, sets up your workspace, and authorizes the agent. No token to copy.
> 4. Once `vibe_heartbeat` works, the agent **registers the pre-installed skills** for
>    you: this starter ships the VVibe skills in `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`,
>    so VVibe doesn't know about them yet and their `vibe_*` tools stay hidden until
>    it's told. For **each** VVibe skill folder the agent calls
>    `vibe_report_skill_installed` (reading the `version:` from that skill's
>    `SKILL.md`), which turns on their tools (e.g. `vibe_list_members`) and marks
>    onboarding complete. (Two differ: **analytics** connects your Google Analytics via
>    a hosted click; **blog-render** is read-only.)
> 5. The agent **sets your product basics** so the dashboard and skills have context:
>    `vibe_update_brand` fills your **product name**, **website** (`appBaseUrl`), and a
>    short plain-language **description**. Your product website is **required for
>    analytics** — if the agent can't find it in the repo it'll ask you. (Edit these any
>    time in dashboard **Settings** — a fresh account starts blank, so don't skip this or
>    the dashboard stays empty.)
>
> **Non-interactive / headless session (no browser) — the API-key path.** A browser login
> can't be completed without a human, and the CLI won't change that (it only writes
> config). Don't block on it — create a **VVibe API key** (`pcs_test_…` / `pcs_live_…`) in
> the dashboard at https://vvibe.ai and put `VVIBE_API_KEY=…` in `.env`. Member sync,
> analytics, and product-brain work over REST with no browser; email and blog are
> MCP-only, so they wait for a one-time interactive login (skill registration in sub-step
> 4 turns on the `vibe_*` tools, which only an agent uses). Self-hosters on a token-only
> host (`MCP_OAUTH_ENABLED` off) use the same key path, or paste an MCP connection token
> into `.mcp.json` as a `Bearer` header. Keep secrets out of git.
>
> ## 2. Register Portaly Payment (~3 min)
> 1. Go to **https://portaly.cc/payment** and create an account.
> 2. In the Portaly dashboard, issue an API key + **callback secret**. Start with a
>    **test** key (`pcs_test_…`) — TapPay sandbox, no real charges.
> 3. Put them in `.env` yourself (never paste secrets into a chat):
>    ```
>    PORTALY_API_KEY=pcs_test_xxx
>    PORTALY_CALLBACK_SECRET=xxx
>    ```
> 4. Make sure `.env` is git-ignored.
>
> ## 3. Provision your resources (let your agent drive)
> With keys in place, ask your agent to use the pre-installed skills:
> - **portaly-payment** — create your subscription plan(s) / product(s) and merchant
>   config, then confirm the checkout in this starter works end to end.
> - **vvibe-analytics** — set your GA4 measurement ID and connect GA to the VVibe
>   dashboard so traffic + the showcase events show up.
> - **vvibe-product-brain** — teach VVibe about your product (powers email / blog).
> - **vvibe-member**, **vvibe-email**, **vvibe-blog-writer/render** — add as you grow.
>
> **No AI agent?** Do the same in the web dashboards — the skills just automate
> these: create your plan(s)/product(s) at https://portaly.cc/payment, and connect
> Google Analytics from the VVibe dashboard at https://vvibe.ai/dashboard/analytics.
> Then fill the resulting ids/keys into `.env` (see `.env.example` for the names).
>
> ## 4. Make it yours
> Restyle the UI, swap the showcase product for your real offer, and ship. The
> wiring stays the same — you only changed the content and the keys.
>
> ## 5. Deploy to InsForge (recommended)
> **InsForge** is vvibe's hosting partner — it deploys this app and can be your
> backend (database, auth, storage, functions) as you build past the showcase.
> 1. Sign up at **https://insforge.dev/auth/sign-up?ref=VVIBE** (free to start).
> 2. Deploy with the InsForge CLI — or, if your agent has the **insforge** /
>    **insforge-cli** skill, ask it to deploy this starter; it provisions your
>    project and pushes the frontend, writing its own config.
> 3. Add your VVibe + Portaly env vars (steps 1–2) to the InsForge project so the
>    live site can reach them.
>
> ## Cheat sheet
> | Need | Where |
> |---|---|
> | VVibe connect (interactive) | agent drives; one browser login, no token to copy |
> | VVibe connect (headless / REST) | `VVIBE_API_KEY` in `.env` — from the VVibe dashboard, no browser |
> | Product basics (name / website / description) | agent sets via `vibe_update_brand`, or dashboard Settings — website (`appBaseUrl`) is required for analytics |
> | Portaly account | https://portaly.cc/payment |
> | Portaly key + callback secret | Portaly dashboard → creator-subscription |
> | Deploy / hosting | InsForge — https://insforge.dev/auth/sign-up?ref=VVIBE |
> | What's wired & where | the `## ⚡ vvibe-optimized` block in `AGENTS.md` |

## Notes for the production agent

- Do **not** fill in any real values — the playbook is instructions for the forker.
- `.env.example` must contain **placeholders only**. `.mcp.json` ships the public
  cloud MCP URL (`https://mcp.vvibe.ai`) with **no token** — OAuth is per-forker and
  happens in the browser, so there is no secret to place here.
- If the base app already has a `VVIBE_STARTER.md`, the script overwrites it (it owns
  that file); the marker block in `AGENTS.md` is what's merged idempotently.
